# Outpost 2 Workspace Helper

This repo is designed to jump start your OP2 dev by downloading all of the OP2 repos you need for your workspace.

All you need is a CLI terminal with `git`, `curl`, and `unzip`. If you are on Windows, you will want to use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/download/win) WSL or some other terminal emulator that gives you `git` and other CLI utility commands. To set everything up, just `curl` and run the [install script](https://github.com/OutpostUniverse/OP2-Workspace/blob/master/bin/install)

    bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OutpostUniverse/OP2-Workspace/master/bin/install)
